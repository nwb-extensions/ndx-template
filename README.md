## About

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/nwb-extensions/ndx-template/_apis/build/status/nwb-extensions.ndx-template?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/nwb-extensions/ndx-template/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

This repo provides a template for creating Neurodata Extensions (NDX) for the
[Neurodata Without Borders](https://nwb.org/)
 data standard.

We currently support creating Neurodata Extensions only using Python.
MATLAB support is in development.

## Getting started

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your operating system if it is not already installed.

2. Install [cookiecutter](https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter/) (see [here](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for Windows install instructions), [pynwb](https://pypi.org/project/pynwb/), and [hdmf-docutils](https://pypi.org/project/hdmf-docutils/).
`cookiecutter` is a Python-based command-line utility that creates projects from templates.
```bash
python -m pip install cookiecutter "pynwb>=1.5.0" "hdmf-docutils>=0.4.4"
```
3. Run cookiecutter on your local working directory:
```bash
cookiecutter gh:nwb-extensions/ndx-template
```
4. Answer the prompts, which will be used to fill in the blanks throughout the
template automatically. You will be prompted for:
    - `namespace` - The name of the namespace for your extension. This could be a
    description of the extension (e.g., "ndx-cortical-surface") or the name of your
    lab or group (e.g., "ndx-allen-institute"). **Namespaces MUST start with "ndx-".**
      - The name should generally follow the following naming conventions:
        - Use only lower-case ASCII letters (no special characters)
        - Use "-" to separate different parts of the name (no spaces allowed)
        - Be short and descriptive
    - `description` - A description of your extension in simple terms
    - `author` - Your name. This can also be a comma-separated list of names.
    - `email` - Your email address. This can also be a comma-separated list of email addresses.
    - `github_username` - Your username on GitHub. This can also be a comma-separated list of usernames.
    - `copyright` - Copyright statement, if desired
    - `version` - Version of your extension. Versioning should start at 0.1.0 and follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines
    - `release` - Release category, e.g. "alpha", "beta", "official"
    - `license` - Name of license used for your extension source code.
    A permissive license, such as BSD, should be used if possible.
5. A new folder with the same name as your entered `namespace` will be
created. See `NEXTSTEPS.md` in that folder for the next steps in creating
your awesome new Neurodata Extension.

In case cookiecutter runs into problems and you want to avoid reentering
all the information, you can edit the file `~/.cookiecutter_replay/ndx-template.json`,
and use that via `cookiecutter --replay gh:nwb-extensions/ndx-template`.

See the [PyNWB tutorial](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/general/extensions.html) for guidance on how to write your extension.

When you are done creating your extension, we encourage you to follow the steps
to publish your Neurodata Extension in the [NDX Catalog](https://github.com/nwb-extensions/) for the benefit of the
greater neuroscience community! :)
